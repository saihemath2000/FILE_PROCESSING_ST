Definitions and DU Paths in FileManagerService
1. Method: readTextFile
Definitions (defs):
content (Line 11): Initialized to collect file content.
reader (Line 17): BufferedReader to read the file.
line (Line 18): Used to store each line of the file.
DU Paths:
DU Path 1: A valid .txt file is provided, and content is read successfully.
DU Path 2: The provided file does not have a .txt extension, triggering the if condition.
DU Path 3: The file cannot be read (e.g., does not exist), triggering the catch block.
2. Method: writeTextFile
Definitions (defs):
writer (Line 33): BufferedWriter to write content to the file.
DU Paths:
DU Path 1: File exists and is written to successfully in append mode.
DU Path 2: An exception occurs while writing to the file (not explicitly handled here but relevant for robustness).
3. Method: readCSV
Definitions (defs):
data (Line 40): Stores the rows of the CSV file as lists of strings.
line (Line 43): Holds each line read from the file.
columns (Line 45): Holds the split columns for a single row.
DU Paths:
DU Path 1: A valid CSV file is provided, and all rows are read successfully.
DU Path 2: The file cannot be read due to an exception (e.g., file not found).
4. Method: writeCSV
Definitions (defs):
writer (Line 55): FileWriter to append rows to a CSV file.
row (Line 57): Each row of the provided data.
DU Paths:
DU Path 1: File exists, and rows are appended successfully.
DU Path 2: An exception occurs while writing (not explicitly handled but relevant).
5. Method: readJsonFile
Definitions (defs):
objectMapper (Line 63): Used to deserialize the JSON file.
DU Paths:
DU Path 1: A valid JSON file is read successfully and deserialized into the expected class.
DU Path 2: File deserialization fails due to invalid JSON format or other errors, triggering the catch block.
6. Method: writeJsonFile
Definitions (defs):
file (Line 75): Refers to the file object for the provided path.
dataList (Line 78): Stores the list of MyData objects to be written.
DU Paths:
DU Path 1: File exists and is successfully updated with new data.
DU Path 2: File does not exist, so a new one is created and written.
DU Path 3: An exception occurs while reading/writing the file (e.g., invalid file path).
Explanation of Test Cases
Test Case 1: testReadTextFile_ValidFile
DU Path Tested: DU Path 1 of readTextFile
Explanation:
Creates a valid .txt file.
Writes some test content to the file.
Reads the file using readTextFile.
Validates that the read content matches the written content.
Purpose: To ensure the method correctly handles valid .txt files.
Test Case 2: testReadTextFile_InvalidExtension
DU Path Tested: DU Path 2 of readTextFile
Explanation:
Provides a file with an invalid extension (e.g., .csv).
Expects the method to return an error message indicating invalid file type.
Purpose: To verify that the method rejects non-text files.
Test Case 3: testReadTextFile_FileNotFound
DU Path Tested: DU Path 3 of readTextFile
Explanation:
Provides a file path for a non-existent file.
Expects the method to return an error message indicating a reading failure.
Purpose: To ensure proper handling of file-not-found errors.
Test Case 4: testWriteTextFile_AppendContent
DU Path Tested: DU Path 1 of writeTextFile
Explanation:
Creates a valid text file and writes initial content.
Appends additional content to the file using writeTextFile.
Validates that the appended content is present.
Purpose: To verify the correct functionality of the append mode.
Test Case 5: testReadCSV_ValidFile
DU Path Tested: DU Path 1 of readCSV
Explanation:
Creates a valid CSV file with headers and one data row.
Reads the file using readCSV.
Validates that the returned data matches the file content.
Purpose: To ensure the method correctly handles valid CSV files.
Test Case 6: testWriteJsonFile_ValidData
DU Path Tested: DU Path 1 of writeJsonFile
Explanation:
Prepares a MyData object with sample data.
Writes the object to a JSON file.
Validates that the file exists after writing.
Purpose: To verify successful writing of JSON data, especially appending to existing data.
How These Test Cases Cover DU Paths
readTextFile: Covers all three DU paths by testing valid files, invalid extensions, and non-existent files.
writeTextFile: Covers the primary DU path (successful writing) but could be extended to test exception handling.
readCSV: Covers valid file reading and edge cases (e.g., empty files or missing headers can be added as extensions).
writeCSV: Focuses on the DU path for successful writing but could be extended for exception handling.
readJsonFile: Could be extended to test invalid JSON formats or file-not-found scenarios.
writeJsonFile: Covers DU paths for appending to existing files and writing new files.
